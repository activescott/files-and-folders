# files and folders command line utilities

Utilities to manage files and folders that I wanted. Trying to make them reusable and portable. Requests and pull requests welcomed!

## dedupe-files

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dedupe-files.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dedupe-files)
[![Node Version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/dedupe-files.svg)](https://github.com/activescott/files-and-folders)

```sh
Usage: dedupe-files <command> [options]

Finds all duplicate files across the set of paths and then will **print** them out, **move** them to a directory, or **delete** them. Duplicates are identified by their actual content not their name or other attributes.

Options:
  -h, --help                        display help for command

Commands:
  print [options] <input_paths...>  print out duplicates
  move [options] <input_paths...>   move duplicates to a directory
  delete <input_paths...>           delete duplicate files
  help [command]                    display help for command

Examples:

The following prints out a line to duplicates.txt for each duplicate file found in /Volumes/photos and /Volumes/backups/photos:

  $ dedupe-files print --out "duplicates.txt" "/Volumes/photos" "/Volumes/backups/photos"

The following moves each duplicate file found in /Volumes/photos and /Volumes/backups/photos to ~/Downloads/duplicates.
The files in ~/Downloads/one are considered more "original" than those in ~/Downloads/two since it appears earlier on the command line:

  $ dedupe-files move --out "~/Downloads/duplicates" "~/Downloads/one" "~/Downloads/two"
```

### Example

```sh
$ npx dedupe-files print \
  --out "duplicates.txt" \
  '/Volumes/scott-photos/photos/2014' \
  '/Volumes/home/!Backups/PHOTOS/Photos - backup misc/2014'

## Release Process (Deploying to NPM)

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to consistently release [semver](https://semver.org/)-compatible versions. This project deploys to multiple [npm distribution tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag). Each of the below branches correspond to the following npm distribution tags:

| branch | npm distribution tag |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| main   | latest               |
| beta   | beta                 |

To trigger a release use a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) conventions on one of the above branches. We use the following adjustments to the Conventional Commit conventions:

- **Scope is required**. The scope must be the full name of the package from the package.json. This helps semantic-release and conventional commits work for a monorepo.
